# US-Medical-Insurance-Cost

Data analysis using a dataset about insurance costs in US.

This is my project on US Medical Insurance costs with the use of Python and Power BI. I used only some basic foundations of Python (not Numpy or Pandas) to answer questions. After, I used Power BI to create visualizations that can illustrate informations produced from my simple Python code. The main goal of the project is to help USA people reduce their insurance charges. The outcome is that the number one factor that affects our charges is smoking. So, we can use this project also as an anti-smoking campaign. Please take a look! I will be really happy if you contact me in dimnanos32@gmail.com for a feedback. I am on my first steps through data science so I need every possible help that I can get. Thank you for your time!
